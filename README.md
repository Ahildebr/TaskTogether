# TaskTogether

TaskTogether is a full-stack, real-time task collaboration app that allows users to create project boards, add and manage tasks, and invite collaborators â€” all with live updates powered by WebSockets.

Built with Flask, React, SQLAlchemy, and Socket.IO, TaskTogether is ideal for small teams or individuals who want to stay organized and up to date without needing to refresh the page.

ðŸ’¡ How to Use It
Sign Up / Log In to access your dashboard.

Create a Board to start organizing your tasks.

Add Tasks to a board â€” you'll see them live without needing to refresh.

Invite Collaborators to your board by username.

Edit or Delete Tasks/Boards as needed â€” updates appear instantly for all users on the board.

Each board acts as a collaborative workspace where users can keep track of progress in real time.
